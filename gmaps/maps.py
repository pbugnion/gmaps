# I assume (lng0, lng1) in a layer's
# bounds means that the layer wants the map to
# cover all the longitudes that lie
# (going eastwards) from lng0 to lng1.
# For example: (170,-170) means we cover 20 degrees of
# latitude starting at 170 (through 180)
# Whereas (-170,170) means we start where the previous
# interval ended (at 170), go through lng 0, and eventually
# to 170 (340 degrees).
#
# As a side note, this definition means that (lng1,lng0) is
# the complement of (lng0,lng1) on this notation.
# It is important we have this direction information somehow,
# because otherwise the bounds are underspecified.
#
# As another side note, the meaning of (15, 30) in this notation
# is the same as that of (15+/-360, 30) and that of (15, 30 +/- 360),
# because we stop as soon as we hit the coordinate the first
# time.
#
# Note: the google api for setting map bounds seems to follow this
# convention as well, but I'm not sure gmaps overall does.
# (At least, I couldn't verify)
